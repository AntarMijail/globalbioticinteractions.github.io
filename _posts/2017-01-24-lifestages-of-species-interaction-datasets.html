    Just like organisms, datasets get born, grow up, reproduce, and die. GloBI's mission is to help increase the
    productivity (or reuse), and increase the lifespan of, datasets before they meet their maker.
</p>

<p>
    To monitor the lifestage of a datasets, the <a href="http://globalbioticinteractions.org/status" target="_blank">GloBI
    "status" page</a> was
    introduced in January 2017. This page shows the state of the federated collection of species interaction datasets
    that make up GloBI. Rather than treating datasets like static entities, GloBI takes a dynamic approach and revisits
    datasets regularly to incorporate changes and revisit the links to naming authorities (e.g. <a
        href="http://itis.gov" target="_blank">itis.gov</a>),
    gazetteers (e.g. <a href="http://geonames.org" target="_blank">geonames.org</a>) and other relevant external data
    services. Several monitors can be found on the
    status page that indicate whether the dataset can be read, searched or citated. In addition, some statistics are
    provided to point to known issues and the properties of the datasets (e.g. number of interactions, number of names,
    match rate of names). With this, a de-facto publication process is outlined along with quality control measures that
    show how the lifestage of a dataset.

    <div class="figcaption"><p>GloBI continuously discovers species interaction datasets through GitHub and Zenodo. In
        addition, automated review processes can be configured on <a href="https://travis-ci.org">travis-ci</a> to check
        on the "health" of datasets. For more
        information see the <a href="https://github.com/jhoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki/Dataset-Management">data management

<p>
    At time of writing, the status page provides a wealth of information. For instance, the state of the dataset (e.g. <img src="/assets/kelpForestStatus.svg" style="display: inline; height: 1em;"/>)
    provided by <a href="http://kelpforest.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">http://kelpforest.ucsc.edu</a> (<a
        href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0109356" target="_blank">Beas-Luna et al. 2014</a>) indicates that
    the dataset is close to dying or
    already dead: nearly all indicators are red and unresolved issues exist. In contrast, the chance of survival of
    a dataset like the Africa Tree Database (<a href=" https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1526128" target="_blank">Selzer
    et al. 2015</a>) looks promising: indicators are green (e.g. <img src="/assets/africaTreeDatabaseStatus.svg" style="display: inline; height: 1em;"/>), name match rate is
    94% across 1.9k names and 7.7k interactions. In addition, the Africa Tree Database has been deposited with <a
        href="https://figshare.com" target="_blank">Figshare</a>, a service
    that is designed to provide "permanent" data availability through digital object identifiers.

    Over the last couple of weeks, I've used the page to discover and resolve various dataset issues. For example, an
    obscure GloBI bug was found (and resolved) (see
    <a href="https://github.com/hurlbertlab/dietdatabase/issues/40" target="_blank">hurlbertlab/dietdatabase#40</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/276" target="_blank">jhpoelen/eol-globi-data#276</a>)
    that prevented the integration of some interaction records provided by
    the <a href="https://github.com/hurlbertlab/dietdatabase" target="_blank">Avian Diet Database</a>. I am curious to see how the status page will evolve in the next months.
