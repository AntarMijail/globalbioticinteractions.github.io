At the inspiring [GLOBIS-B species interactions workshop](http://www.globis-b.eu/36/workshop_4.html) organized by [Daniel Kissling](https://www.danielkissling.de) _et al._ in Bari, Italy on 26-28 February 2018, a workshop participant asked: "What happens to GloBI if Jorrit [ed. author of this blog post] decides to move to a [desert island](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1065592)?" to which I replied: "GloBI runs by itself."


Reflecting on this existential exchange, I realized that my statement was both an architectural principle and an ambition: the GloBI (community) is designed/organized to run by itself. Where centralized infrastructures, GloBI is more like a suite of tools to discover and integrate species interaction data (see [Ecology of Data](/2016/02/08/ecology-of-data/)). This has become more obvious with the recent introduction of [Elton](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/elton) (discover, cache, stream interaction data) and [Nomer](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer) (linking of terms to taxonomies and ontologies). Both commandline tools are self-contained and can be used on- and offline. Also, they facilitate to [archive datasets to the internet archive](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/elton-archive) and to build things like search indexes. The current search index used by https://globalbioticinteractions.org helps to create reports and do ad-hoc searches via the API, rglobi, or web tools. This search index itself is available for [download](https://globalbioticinteractions.org/data), but, if you'd like, you can host your own, or even better, create your own, faster, better species interaction search index like [Marius BÃ¤sler did with ArrangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/arangodb-graph-to-cytoscape/).

What happens if I move to an deserted island? Perhaps I might forgo paying 20 dollars a year for the domain registration of "globalbioticinteractions.org" or the hosted GloBI server might go dark after the current server space contributor, [Heitlinger Lab at Humboldt University, Berlin](https://www.biologie.hu-berlin.de/de/gruppenseiten/ecoevolpara/) (thanks Emanuel!), decides to no longer donate about 50 euros a month to rent a server at Hetzner beyond September 2020. This server hosts a search index that is automatically rebuilt from scratch every couple of days or so. Please also consider that, even if I am sipping martinis on the beach of some (no longer) deserted island, the species interaction datasets can still be found via zenodo, github, the internet archive or various other data publication platforms, but also via open tools like [Elton](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/elton). Most importantly, even if zendo, github, the internet archive and data journals all go down, the idea remains that yes, you can integrate species interaction data if you publish your datasets in the open and let people know about it.

So, one could argue that GloBI _does_ runs by itself, especially when researchers continue to subscribe to the idea of publishing species interaction datasets such that they can be found, openly accessed, integrated and re-used (as in [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/fairprinciples)) without having to rely on the existence of one centralized system. In fact, the benefits of decentralized [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/fairprinciples)-ness of the species interaction community can be made visible through project like GloBI.
