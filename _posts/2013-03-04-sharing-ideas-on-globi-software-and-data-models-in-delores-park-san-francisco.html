<p>Yesterday (Sunday, March 3), <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertReiz">Robert Reiz</a>, <a href="http://berkeleybop.org/people/chris-mungall/">Chris Mungall</a>, and <a href="http://eol.org/users/56974">I</a> got together in Dolores Park, San Francisco, to talk about software architecture, deployment, and data models while enjoying a windy but sunny winter day. Our discussions were really fun, and I wanted to share some of the sketches we made with y'all. Doesn't a good idea always start with a bunch of drawings on the back of a napkin?</p>
<p>For those tech-savvy people out there, we've created some open-source repositories to host our software and datasets: <a href="http://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data">eol-globi-data</a> for normalizing, enriching, and importing species-interaction datasets; <a href="http://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-rest">eol-globi-rest</a> for implementing an API that is easy to embed in web pages; <a href="http://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-service">eol-globi-service</a> for hosting the normalized datasets; and <a href="http://github.com/reiz/eol-globi-web">eol-globi-web</a>, a Ruby on Rails web app that serves as an example of how to use the EOL-GloBI normalized species-interaction datasets and services. If you have any feedback or have the urge to contribute datasets or coding skills, don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
