<p>Ever wondered what happens beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico? Curious what a<a href="http://eol.org/pages/205100/overview"> king mackerel (<em>Scomberomorus cavalla</em>)</a> eats?  <a href="http://gomexsi.tamucc.edu">GoMexSI</a> might help you find what you're looking for.</p>
<p><div class="figure figure-globi left"><a href="http://gomexsi.tamucc.edu"><img class="alignleft" title="GoMexSI Landing Page" alt="GoMexSI_landing_page" src="/assets/gomexsi_landing_page.png"/></a></div>GoMexSI (Gulf of Mexico Species Interactions) uses GloBI web services to provide the ability to explore marine predator-prey relationships in the Gulf of Mexico. GoMexSI offers three web tools for learning about trophic interactions in the Gulf of Mexico:</p>

<p>1) a taxonomic query tool that lists species-interaction observations with information, 2) a spatial query tool for finding species-interaction observations within a specific geographic area, and 3) a food-web explorer tool that helps to navigate visually through a food web.</p>

<p>GoMexSI not only provides a valuable educational and research tool to study the food webs in the Gulf of Mexico, but also gives a great example of how <a href="http://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki/rest">GloBI web services</a> can be used to recycle, repurpose, and liberate existing species-interaction datasets in our educational and scientific communities. The GoMexSI 1.0-beta version was released to the general public on September 3, 2013.</p>
<p>The GoMexSI website is developed by <a href="http://reedhewitt.com/">Reed Hewett</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/mike-casavecchia/3a/92b/23a">Michael Casavecchia</a> under the guidance of<a href="http://ccs.tamucc.edu/people/dr-james-d-simons/"> James Simons</a> of Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi and <a href="http://eol.org/users/56974">Jorrit Poelen </a>(<a href="http://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data">GloBI</a> developer and author of this post).

<p>The continued success of GloBI and GoMexSI depends on data contributions of ecologist around the world.
