<p>I am happy to share that our proposal "<a href="/assets/Poelen_Rubenstein2013_BioticInteractions_Proposal.pdf">Unleashing EOL's Species Interaction Datasets—Integration, Visualization, and Analysis</a>" was selected for the <a href="http://eol.org/info/485">Rubenstein Fellows Program 2013</a>. I am looking forward to working with <a href="http://ccs.tamucc.edu/people/dr-james-d-simons/">James D. Simons</a>, GoMexSI curator; <a href="http://berkeleybop.org/person/chris-mungall">Chris Mungall</a>, a bioinformaticist; <a href="https://twitter.com/RobertReiz">Robert Reiz</a>, a software engineer; and the EOL community to provide easy access to the massive amounts of species-interaction data that have already been collected. By combining these existing data collections, we are hoping to make it easier for scientists and enthusiasts to better understand species interactions as they happen over time and space.</p>
