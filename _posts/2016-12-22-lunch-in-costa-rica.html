<p>The increased availability of digital records on where organisms hangout (or <em>occur</em>) has been facilitated by <a href="http://www.tdwg.org/activities/darwincore/" target="_blank">Darwin Core</a>, a community standard for exchanging biodiversity information. TDWG (pronounced tahd-wick), the association that helped nature this standards into maturity, held <a href="http://www.tdwg.org/conference2016/" target="_blank">this years annual meeting</a> in Costa Rica. While the primary focus of Darwin Core is on species occurrence, an extension mechanism is provided to help capture other kinds of aspects of biodiversity data. It is temping to say that there are as many extensions as there are biologists that use the mechanism, leaving the burden of integrating non-occurrence data to others... like GloBI!</p>

<p>A long time GloBI contributor, Katja Schulz, presented a poster on a pragmatic approach to integrating species interaction data at the conference. Rather than relying on a single data exchange format, GloBI will take any existing (semi-)structured digital format to make existing datasets easier to access. With this approach, the burden of standardization of existing datasets is reduced. In addition, a continuous integration approach is taken: the datasets are continuously refreshed and linked against taxonomies, ontologies and other biodiversity data services. </p>

<p>Also, she, and some her colleagues, joined for an in-promptu lunch to talk about species interaction data. I hope that outcome of this lunch will contribute to the ongoing development of ways to easily exchange evidence records on how organisms rely on each other.</p>
