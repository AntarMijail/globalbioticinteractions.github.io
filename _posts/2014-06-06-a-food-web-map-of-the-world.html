<p>Sergey Slyusarev, Dimitrios-Georgios Kontopoulos, William Taysom, Adrian Guzman, and Bimlesh Wadhwa used <a href="http://globalbioticinteractions.org">GloBI</a> data to create a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1297762">food-web map</a> [1] as part of the <a href="http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu/">Information Visualization MOOC</a> class of 2014 at <a href="http://indiana.edu">Indiana University</a>. The map was created by combining interaction data from <a href="https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki#accessing-species-interaction-data">GloBI's Darwin Core Archive</a> with <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/terrestrial-ecoregions-of-the-world">terrestrial</a> and <a href="http://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/marine-ecoregions-of-the-world-a-bioregionalization-of-coastal-and-shelf-areas">marine</a> ecoregions of the world and various openly available taxonomies (e.g., <a href="http://itis.gov">ITIS</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/taxonomy/">NCBI</a>, <a href="http://marinespecies.org">WoRMS</a>). After eliminating taxa with few recorded interactions, species with similar predator-prey characteristics were grouped by a custom algorithm that was inspired by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccard index</a>, a similarity measure, and based on <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/igraph/docs/infomap.community">Infomap</a>, a community-detection algorithm. The resulting interconnected taxa communities were then used to make an information-packed (gorgeous!) food-web visualization. The map was generated with a combination of custom R scripts, existing libraries (e.g., <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html">igraph</a>, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Reol/index.html">Reol</a>, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html">rgdal</a>), <a href="http://cytoscape.org">Cytoscape</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator">Adobe Illustrator</a>.</p>

<p>I find the integration of spatial information (e.g., marine, terrestrial) in this graph useful because I can quickly relate specific interactions to regions in the world. For instance, I can easily spot a coastal interaction as a filled node that also has a colored border. In addition, the directionality of the interactions are easy to understand thanks to color coding: predator is orange, prey is blue. Opening the <a href="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2905/14101649902_05e5d7f671_o_d.png">high-resolution image</a> in a run-of-the-mill image viewer, I can easily browse the map by zooming and moving with touch-pad gestures. With the help of this visualization, data anomalies in GloBI's complex data collection were detected, reported through <a href="https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/">GloBI's issue list</a> (see <a href="https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/67">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/64">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/60">here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/issues/59">here</a>), and corrected. This alone tells me that the visualization by Slyusarev et al. is a useful research tool.</p>

Special thanks to all <a href="http://globalbioticinteractions.org/references.html">GloBI data contributors</a>, Sergey for his suggestions for improving GloBI, and <a href="http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?page_id=22226">Scott Weingart</a> of Indiana University for inviting GloBI as a client project of <a href="http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu/">IVMOOC</a> 2014. Can't wait to work with the IVMOOC class of 2015!</p>
